RV's are a magnet for dust and dirt.  Alex has done a great job adjusting to one of the challenges in dating me.  I am super high maintenance when it comes to being clean.  I'm usually the cause of some clutter but I need things to be clean or I tend to start feeling unwarranted stress.  

How crazy is my need for clean?  Today is cleaning day and we have at least one of these per week.

We start at the back of the coach and work forward.  On cleaning day Alex starts with the vacuum at the back of the coach.  I grab our floor towels and shake them off outside.  We purchase cheap towels at Walmart to cover our surfaces instead of mats.  This allows us to dispose of them when they get really dirty without feeling like we are tossing nice rugs. Alex works her way forward vacuuming all the floors and all the fan vent covers and window screens.  

After Alex has the floor vacuumed in the back she moves forward and I get started on the shower.  Even though we squeegee the walls and floor every single shower - We still clean the shower once a week.  All the bathroom surfaces, shower walls, and kitchen counters are wiped with bleach.  By this time Alex has moved far enough forward with the Vacuum that I can get down and mop the floors by hand.  We clean until no dirt is left.  All the corners, all the cracks, and all the surfaces.  

Once I get to the middle of the coach I start wiping down all the cabinets with 409 while Alexis finishes vacuuming the front of the coach.  Even surfaces that look clean get a swipe.  Cabinets, the couch, cabinet handles, all the plastic on the roof, the AC, and everything else.  This all takes about 45 minutes.  

Alex is usually wrapping up vacuuming the front around the time I finish wiping down all the surfaces.   I usually step outside and start wiping down all the steps and the floor by our door.  Alex starts focusing on mopping in between the seats in the front of the coach.  I tackle all the outside steps and all the surfaces by the doors and by the floor.  We both scrub all the metal trim pieces until they are shiny.  All the corners get focus and we get every piece of dirt we can find.

The toilet is thoroughly flushed with fluid multiple times and then we fill the tanks with a gallon of bleach and about 75% water and let them sit for a day.  We flush our black tank multiple times.  In addition to the cleansing process for our tanks we rarely use our toilet for *solids* which keeps any odors to a minimum.

All this effort barely keeps up with the gravel and dirt frequently trekked in or the dirt sucked in by the fan.   In a tiny home, it's really important to always put things where they belong and keep the floors picked up.  

It's important to keep all the surfaces clean and stay on top of the dirt before it settles in. Once you start getting the "RV Smell" - It is my belief you will never get it to go away.

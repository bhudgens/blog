Finding a way to fly around in the snow has become a tradition at MusicFest.  This year was no exception.  The ranch had brand new snow mobiles.  They did not disappoint.

A few years ago a friend of mine randomly came across last-minute tickets to MusicFest.  I paid for the tickets and committed to going.  Last minute I did not make the trip.  He went on and had a great time.  While there he ran into an amazing group of folks who were seasoned veterans of Musicfest.  So last year I was able to tag along with this huge and amazing group of folks.  Last year was my first MusicFest.

To say it got a little crazy would be an understatement.  Surrounded by tons of friends, I somehow managed to disappear for hours.  I can't remember.  They can't remember.  Every night runs till 5AM and we are so lucky to have tons of artists coming to _our_ personal rooms playing private concerns just-for-us.  Musicfest is a blast every year.

Part of the tradition is annual snowmobiling and tubing.  I had never done large scale tubing until last year.  **It is a blast**.  This year the snowmobiles were brand new and cranked out some speed.  We had approximately fifty people in the group which means we _almost_ rent out every snow mobile.

If you have never had a chance to go tubing or snowmobiling, or perhaps like me, you felt it would be boring - it is not!  They are both activites to try when you're up in the mountains.

Last night was our first taste of staying on a pull-off in a National Forest.  We had read about it but had not experienced it for ourselves.  It's quiet.  Very.. Very.. Quiet.  A woodpecker was my morning alarm clock.  

## Waking Up In A Forest

We worked a normal day yesterday but [headed into the forest](/national%20parks/arkansas/ozark-national-forest/) at the end of our day.  We had a little sun to spare but decided it wasn't enough to comfortably make a three mile hike and enjoy it.  We pulled off and slept in a random spot in the middle of the forest.

Sleeping in the middle of the forest is a bit intoxicating.  It's very quiet and the sounds are relaxing.  We slept with our windows wide open and woke to a beautiful sunrise and a woodpecker pounding on a tree.  The weather is absolutely wonderful right now.

We decided to hike a more popular trail we had found online.  We took our time getting ready and headed to our hike.  The road to the hike is off the highway.  It's approximately six miles down a long dirt road.  The road is bumpy, narrow, and uneven in plenty of places.

## Hiking - Whitaker Point

The hike was heavily traveled.  There were tons of families and folks of various body types heading in and coming back.  This is good because I'm fat and if you see nothing but fit people coming off the trail then I'm likely to have a heart attack and die in the middle of the forest.  

We took an aggressive pace and hiked approximately 1.5 miles inland.  The hike is mostly down hill on the way in with the trail moderately paved from all the traffic.  You can tell this would be a very pretty hike in a different season.  Right now all the trees are dead and there isn't much color.  Our pictures are pretty boring and dull.

## Flying The Drone - National Forest

Adding a drone into my camera arsenal has been exciting.  I'm able to capture shots you couldn't otherwise get.  I used the drone to travel ahead a couple miles and scope out our drive on our dirt road to make sure the RV wouldn't have any problems.  I've also been able to look over mountain ranges and fly down creeks to see if something is interesting to pursue.  It's been handy.

Flying a drone comes with a bit of responsibility.  For starters, people hate change and drones are new.  Regulations for drones are rapidly evolving.  Law enforcement is often misinformed about who regulates drone use; and, this passes down to civilians being misinformed.  

Drone use in National Forests is perfectly legal under the [most recent documentation released by the Nat'l Park Service](https://www.fs.fed.us/science-technology/fire/unmanned-aircraft-systems).  Park rangers will still tell people they are not legal.

I was taking a picture of a sunset over a farm when a couple stopped to inform me that flying my drone was "highly illegal in National Forests".  You could tell they were annoyed and threatened to take my license plate.  I encouraged them to do so and patiently explained the law.  Once I started rattling off specific sections of the FAA code and snippets of the National Forest guidelines they quickly retracted.  It was an awkward encounter but brought visibility to a bigger problem; people don't like them because they're new.  

When I stared using my drone I did a tremendous amount of research.  You are required to register with the FAA and display your license number prominently on the drone.  You are also required to follow a slew of guidelines.

Since people tend to have drastically different feelings about drone use I've made an effort to be respectful and keep mine out-of-site-out-of-mind.  Even if I'm within my rights to fly _around_ an area with people I tend to fly really high and stay less noticeable.  Drones can pollute a beautiful scene with noise.  They can be pretty loud.

Part of what makes road trips great and memorable is the getting there. The drive. The stops along the way. Taking backroads, stopping at small town markets, eating at an unknown diner. You see something that looks interesting? Pull over and check it out! That's how I found a small trail to a waterfall right off a coastal highway in Oregon. It's what led us to the Chandelier Tree in California as we came off of Hwy 1 and joined up with Hwy 101. Take time to sing along to the radio and just sit quietly taking in the view through your front windows. Go down that side road that looked interesting, and take the scenic routes. Stop for photos and more importantly, take photos of each other and random things. As someone that usually focuses on taking pictures of the scenery or the place I am visiting, I find that I usually regret not having more pictures of moments, or videos of being silly in the car.

We forget that the point of this journey for this is to take it slow and to not rush. To not worry about skipping a day of driving to get somewhere, and only drive an hour or two here and there. Our adventure is about experiences and memories. It won't be long days of driving that stand out in the years to come, but the easy going days where we explored a random part of the country. The both of us are incredibly fortunate that our jobs and status in life allow us the freedom and flexibility to go on this adventure. I look forward to the places I don't yet know we'll go, and of the memories I'll make getting there.

I've never been good with the concept of 'we'. I have had a hard time imaging 'us' and coming to the realization that things are 'ours'. In my mind, there was always a divide between his things and mine. So for me, living together in something we both contribute to is a huge deal and brand new. There's no longer a my apartment/his apartment. We share rent and gas and groceries. It's OUR bathroom and OUR home. 

I've read many a blog in the past weeks of other couples that transition to traveling and living in an RV full-time. And a good deal of them have a common point that they make - they aren't sure how they can live together in such a small space. People we've spoken to since transitioning to this lifestyle also share the same views. They don't think they could tolerate each other. In our RV there are no rooms (except maybe the bathroom). There is no separate bedroom or kitchen to go to for space. It is all one open area. And for us, at least so far, that hasn't been a problem. The idea of being unable to stand each other or share a small space was never a concern for us, and never even crossed our minds. Which brings me to question - what are we doing right? 

Yes, we have arguments. But ultimately we work together and know that 'we' are more important than whatever disagreement we come across. We find joy in being able to look up from our laptops and see our partner sitting there mere feet away. He is very much type A, while I am clearly type B. So in arguments, it's often that I'm being sensitive or flat out not thinking things through clearly. Living with a type A partner has helped me in terms of realizing what is and isn't worth getting upset over. He's also helped me become better at letting things go, and not letting little things that ultimately don't matter build up from internalizing. 

Traveling is the best thing we've done together, and I'd say the best thing we've done for 'us'. I know that having space and an independence is natural and even healthy. I know that some think we're crazy and wonder how we do it. But I wonder how two people that have to question if they could get along long-term cooped up are truly happy.

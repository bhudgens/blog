<!--  TODO: Check names of hikes and the Pig something or other road we took -->
Along the route to Savannah, Georgia, we did some Googling and decided to venture through Ozark National Forest in Arkansas. The main attraction we read about is the hike to Whitaker Point, also known as "something-crag". 

We headed into the forest on Friday and took Hwy 23 north from I-40, along Pig "something" road. Even in the end of winter with little color or leaves on the trees it was a beautiful drive. The road is very windy and there are parts of it that feel like driving through a tunnel of trees. I imagine it is an incredible drive in the spring and fall, and look forward to returning to this area. 

## Trouble on the road

On Hwy 16 just passed Boston we saw a UPS truck pulled over on the side of the road. As we got closer to him, we saw that there was a motorcycle that had skidded off the road and was laying in the ditch. We got out to see if we could help and to talk to the UPS driver, and found that whoever had been riding the motorcycle was nowhere to be found. A few other locals also drove up as we were looking around to make sure the rider hadn't been thrown into the trees to see if they could help. Fortunately, we couldn't find anyone but the bike was still warm so we knew it had to of happened recently. We can only hope that the rider either had another friend riding another motorcycle alongside them, or that someone drove up before we did and took the rider to get looked at and taken care of. 

## Friday Night

By the time we got to the 6.9-mile dirt road to get to the trail head, it was 5PM and too late to do the full hike before dark. Already on the dirt road with few options to turn around in an RV, we found a small turnout on the right-side of the road that we decided to park in for the night. Ben flew his drone to get some air shots of the sunset, and I played around with the Canon to see if I could get some photos of the area. It's pretty awesome being out here in the middle of nowhere surrounded by trees and nothing else.

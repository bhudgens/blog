This weekend we left the comfortable city of Chattanooga to head east to Charleston. We spent a couple days in Summerville before heading into Charleston on Saturday. 

Summerville seemed like a fairly small city - or maybe a large town. But man was it packed. We of course headed to the closest Wal-Mart and Starbucks. Every parking lot we passed was packed. It felt like the whole population of Summerville flocked to a square mile radius of stores. While in Summerville we went to the movie theater across the main street from Wal-Mart. Both times we went it was incredibly busy. The main lobby was full of people and the concession stand lines were 20 to 30 minutes long. I don't think I'd ever seen a theater as busy as this one. 

The drive to Charleston was fairly quick - about 30 or 45 minutes. Downtown Charleston was absolutely beautiful. It was a tight squeeze for us in our Pleasure-Way, but we managed to make it through and find some parking just down the road from the Waterfront Park. Since we had gotten there mid-afternoon we decided to spend the day at the park enjoying the weather. It was relaxing to sit on a bench and watch the water from the park. The famous Pineapple Fountain was just a few yards away from where we sat. A lot of families were there enjoying the park as well. Some there to see the fountain, others laying out on the grass or tossing a frisbee. 

Charleston was an exploratory stop for us to check the city out. We will definitely be back with a smaller vehicle to move around the streets of downtown in.
